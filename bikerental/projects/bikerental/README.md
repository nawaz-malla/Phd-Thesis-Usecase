#Bike Rental Smart Contract – Thesis Experimentation
Overview

This repository contains the implementation and experimentation code for a Bike Rental System developed as part of a thesis project.
The project focuses on analyzing, comparing, and improving smart contract design by implementing:

Basic Contract – an initial, minimal version of the Bike Rental smart contract

Updated Contract – an enhanced version with additional features, optimizations, or security improvements

The experimentation aims to demonstrate functional differences, performance, security, and design improvements between the two versions.

#Objectives

To design a decentralized Bike Rental system using smart contracts

To implement a basic version as a baseline

To improve the contract through an updated version

To experimentally compare both contracts based on defined criteria (e.g., functionality, security, and maintainability)
