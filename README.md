# Thesis Experiment: BikeRental & HotelBooking Projects

This repository contains the **Thesis Experimentation Projects** for my PhD use case. It combines two separate projects:

- [BikeRental](./bikerental)
- [HealthCare](./healthcare)  
- [HotelBooking](./hotelbooking)  

Each project includes its **contracts**, **experiment scripts**, and **supporting files**. This combined repository is intended for thesis experimentation and demonstration.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a thesis use case combining two decentralized application projects: **BikeRental** , **HealthCare** and **HotelBooking**. Both projects involve smart contract development, testing, and deployment for experimentation purposes.

---

## Projects

### BikeRental
- Location: `bikerental/`
- Contains smart contracts, deployment scripts, and a README file with detailed instructions.
- Experimentation includes rental operations, contract testing, and interaction simulation.


### HealthCare
- Location: `healthcare/`
- Contains smart contracts, deployment scripts, and a README file with detailed instructions.
- Experimentation includes xray operations, appointments, and interaction simulation.

### HotelBooking
- Location: `hotelbooking/`
- Contains smart contracts, deployment scripts, and a README file with detailed instructions.
- Includes both **Basic Contract** and **Updated Contract** for experimentation.
- Experimentation covers booking scenarios and contract testing.

## Contracts

All projects include smart contracts written in Python/Algorand-compatible formats.  

- **BikeRental Contracts**: `bikerental/projects/bikerental/smart_contracts/bikerental`
- **HealthCare Contracts**: `xray-exam/projects/xray-exam/smart_contracts/healthcare`
- **HotelBooking Contracts**: `hotelbooking/projects/hotelbooking/smart_contracts/hotelbooking/`  

**HotelBooking** has two versions of contracts:

1. **Basic Contract** – Original functionality.  
2. **Updated Contract** – Includes improvements and additional features.
